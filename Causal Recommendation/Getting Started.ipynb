    "## What is RecoGym?\n",
    "\n",
    "RecoGym is a Python [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment for testing recommendation algorithms.  It allows for the testing of both offline and reinforcement-learning based agents.  It provides a way to test algorithms in a toy environment quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will code a simple recommendation agent that suggests an item in proportion to how many times it has been viewed.  We hope to inspire you to create your own agents and test them against our baseline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the most out of RecoGym, we suggest you have some experience coding in Python, some background knowledge in recommender systems, and familiarity with the reinforcement learning setup.  Also, be sure to check out the python-based requirements in the README if something below errors."

    "## Reinforcement Learning Setup\n",
    "\n",

    "## Organic and Bandit\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though our focus is biased towards online advertising, we tried to make RecoGym universal to all types of recommendation.  Hence, we introduce the domain-agnostic terms Organic and Bandit sessions.  An Organic session is an observation of items the user interacts with.  For example, it could be views of products on an e-commerce website, listens to songs while streaming music, or readings of articles on an online newspaper.  A Bandit session is one where we have an opportunity to recommend the user an item and observe their behaviour.  We receive a reward if they click.\n",

    "## Offline and Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was born out of a desire to improve Criteo's recommendation system by exploring reinforcement learning algorithms. We quickly realised that we couldn't just blindly apply RL algorithms in a production system out of the box. The learning period would be too costly. Instead, we need to leverage the vast amounts of offline training examples we already to make the algorithm perform as good as the current system before releasing into the online production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, RecoGym follows a similar flow. An agent is first given access to many offline training examples produced from a fixed policy. Then, they have access to the online system where they choose the actions."
